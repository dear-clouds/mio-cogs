# mio-cogs for V3.5+

Random cogs I've made for myself, this might not be useful to you but if it is, awesome.

I'm still working on some of those cogs, but if you can't wait, please only install those listed below. You can star this repo in the meantime and I will update once it's ready for use.

# Installation

```
[p]repo add mio-cogs https://github.com/dear-clouds/mio-cogs
```

## Reward Role

The purpose of this cog is to assign a role to active users based on specific conditions. You also have the option to count a message consisting solely of a URL as contribution towards activity or not (to avoid spamming activity).

```
[p]cog install mio-cogs rewardrole
```

**How to use**
```
[p]rewardrole add <role> <min_messages> <timeframe_days> <reward_role> <count_only_link_messages true or false> [excluded_roles] [ignored_channels] [ignored_categories]
```

## Jobs

A cog to create a Job System where users can make money (Redbot bank). This cog can be used via text & appplication commands. And even via modal once the first job posted.

```
[p]cog install mio-cogs jobs
```
